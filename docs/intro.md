## About

Foxy is a C++14 library that aims to make idiomatic usage of
[Boost.Beast](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/beast/doc/html/index.html)
and [Boost.Asio](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/boost_asio.html)
easier.

Foxy features:
* session-based wrappers for Beast's `http::async_*` functions
* automatic timeouts for stream operations
* transparent support for SSL/TLS
* URI parser combinators (writen in
[Boost.Spirit.X3](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/spirit/doc/x3/html/index.html))
* support for Asio's universal async model of execution
* simple and experimental TLS forward proxy

## Motivation

Foxy aims to be competitive with the HTTP libraries offered by both Node.js and Go.

While these languages are significantly higher-level than C++ is, their standard HTTP libraries are
low-level from an abstract perspective. The success of these languages and their libraries has shown
that the modern web  development is favoring an ever-lower set of HTTP APIs.

Beast and Asio are both low-level but in their case, the pendulum has swung too far in the other
direction and they're known for being intimidating and difficult to use (mainly just Asio).

Foxy steps in and fills this gap, offering a low-level set of session-based primitives that empower
users to create their own abstractions while also offering much more familiar APIs.
